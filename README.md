# Currency Converter App

This is a simple React Native app that converts Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR) to US Dollars (USD) using a fixed exchange rate (Rs. 300 = 1 USD). The app provides an intuitive user interface using `react-native-paper` and includes features like real-time conversion, error handling, and loading indicators.

## Features

- **Currency Conversion:** Converts LKR to USD using a fixed exchange rate.
- **User-Friendly UI:** A simple, clean interface designed with React Native Paper components.
- **Loading Indicator:** Displays a spinner while the conversion is in progress.
- **Error Handling:** Shows an error message if an invalid LKR amount is entered.
- **Clear Button:** A reset button to clear the input amount and start a new conversion.
